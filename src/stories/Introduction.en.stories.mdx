# Portfoliem design system

## üî• Mission

The mission of this personal development is to redesign complex problems into simple and beautiful visuals through software.

With the spread of the Internet around the world, all kinds of information has become interconnected, like the nerves of the brain. This has given humanity the ability to process information at an advanced level, but at the same time, we have to deal with increasingly complex information. I would like to solve these complex problems with the power of software and design, and I would like to create software and web applications.

## üëÄ Vision

We want to democratize development by separating the UI components of an app from the business logic, data, and context. Reusable components and guidelines will help with contribution and development, and the Portfoliem design system will make it as easy as possible for all community members to contribute.

## üëè How to get involved

If you notice any bugs or changes that need to be made, please follow the [contribution guide](https://github.com/chidoriashi1990/portfoliem-storybook/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub and let us know. We will involve you throughout the process and try to meet your needs.
We look forward to discussing your ideas for design and improvement on [GitHub](https://github.com/chidoriashi1990/portfoliem-storybook).

## üíé Values

### Go Challenging

We will not only implement, but also tackle new challenges at the same time.

### Be a Beautiful

It provides an experience that is more beautiful and valuable than the existing one.

### To be Consistent

Ensure consistency in data and design so that everyone perceives it the same way.

## ‚ú® Brand Identity

### Consistent design

With Material Design as a core component, consistency is maintained through components such as logos, color palettes, and typography.

### Playful and expressive

We will incorporate flexible, creative expressions that appeal to the emotions of the user. We will explore new expressive power through approaches to illustration, animation, and photography.

### A refined icon

Express your services with icons that are easily recognizable at a glance and have a strong presence in any situation.

## üé® Brand color

<img className="image-item" src={BrandColor} alt="brand color" />

Define your brand color based on the elements that make up me. Midnight blue is a calming, yet playful brand expression for adults.

### Functional Colors

<img className="image-item" src={FunctionalColor1} alt="functional color 1" />
<img className="image-item" src={FunctionalColor2} alt="functional color 2" />
<img className="image-item" src={FunctionalColor3} alt="functional color 3" />

### Background Colors

<img className="image-item" src={BackgroundColor1} alt="background color 1" />
<img className="image-item" src={BackgroundColor2} alt="background color 2" />

### Accent Colors

<img className="image-item" src={AccentColor1} alt="accent color 1" />
<img className="image-item" src={AccentColor2} alt="accent color 2" />
<img className="image-item" src={AccentColor3} alt="accent color 3" />
<img className="image-item" src={AccentColor4} alt="accent color 4" />

The use of accent colors allows for a more flexible and dynamic expression. This color is used to both express and emphasize a function. It is mainly used when you want to show your presence to the world with something like a sticker on your car or travel bag.
